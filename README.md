# Speech-Translator-to-Hindi-Text:

* We need to install the Two Libraries:
1. speech_recognition.
2. Translator.

In Jupyter Notebook we may write Command: 
!pip install speechrecognition.
!pip install Translator.

Incase if we want  to Modify the Language we can Modify the Translator function Parameter to_lang into the required Language. 


Happy Coding.
